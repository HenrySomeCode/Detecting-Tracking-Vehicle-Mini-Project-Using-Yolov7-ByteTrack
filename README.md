# Detecting and Tracking Vehicle Mini Project

Hi, 

This is my final project of the AI/ML/DL Course by Master Tuan Linh & TA. For this project, I have prepared a [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gyMk2GJACnHNVbovAKS80NI34XbWbW1-5iVOCwMP3GA/edit?usp=sharing) here that helps me to tell the development of Yolov1 to v7 in detail. 

Besides it also contains ByteTrack's slides . If you want to run this repo, I think it will be hard to implement all the necessary packages. Personally, it takes me more than a half day to do it, so...good luck to you. 

Actually, it will be quite easy to do this through 'pip install -r requiremnet.txt,' but the origin project from [theos-ai](https://github.com/theos-ai/easy-yolov7) runs on CPU while mine is GPU. 

So I have to download Anaconda and then make a Python 3.10 that contains Pytorch that supports GPU. After that, I manually 'pip install' every package one by one cause if you run requirement.txt, it will be crashed. 


Anyway this project references this repo [theos-ai](https://github.com/theos-ai/easy-yolov7), but I have changed some things for my personal purpose. 

And if you're Vietnamese, you can listen to my representation of this project to understand what I have changed and have a clear thinking about my project. 

I recommend you to hear this since it will save you a lot of time to get my project and also can understand the pros & cons of this project provided by both Master Tuan Linh & TA. 

Also, I am sorry for the many sighs at first and maybe during the representation since I was a bit nervous.
